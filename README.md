# InverseOptimalControl
Matlab and Python code to:

1) Estimate individual's sensory and motor speed in a simulated driving task, in which subjects were instructed to push the joystick to the maximal forward position once observing car's motion onset. Using different car speeds in the experiment.

2) Recovering reward function in a stop-sign task using inverse optimal control using sensorimotor speed estimated from 1) in the dynamic matrix.
