# InverseOptimalControl
Matlab and Python code to:

1) Estimate individual's sensory and motor speed in a simulated driving task, in which subjects were instructed to push the joystick to the maximal forward position once observing car's motion onset. Different car speeds were used in the experiment.

2) Recovering reward function in a stop-sign task, in which subjects were instructed to drive a virtual car to a stop-sign as quickly as possible and stop as close as possible, using inverse optimal control using sensorimotor speed estimated from 1) in the dynamic matrix.
